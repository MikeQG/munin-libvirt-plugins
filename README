This is a set of munin plugins to monitor virtual machines managed via libvirt.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

== Setting things up ==

Autoconfiguration is simple. Run:

    munin-libvirt-plugins-detect

this will try to detect the hypervisor, create an apropriate configuration and
enable all plugins.

If you prefer to configure things by hand: The default uri used to connect to
libvirt is "qemu:///system". This can be changed in the plugin configuration:

cat <<EOF >/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/libvirt
[libvirt-*]
env.uri xen:///
EOF

Enabling plugins by hand is the same as with any other munin plugin:

   ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/libvirt-<plugin> /etc/munin/plugins/
   /etc/init.d/munin-node restart

== Plugin Configuration ==

libvirt-mem and libvirt-cputime support limits[1] for critical and warning
values. These are set to 90% (warning) and 95% (critical) by default. However
you can change them in /etc/munin/munin.conf:

[somehost.example.com]
libvirt_cputime.total_pc.warning  60
libvirt_cputime.total_pc.critical 75
libvirt_mem.total_pc.warning  25
libvirt_mem.total_pc.critical 50
